<!-- [It can be accessed here.](deploy link) -->

## Rubric

This project was completed as a project at Turing School of Software & Design during Module 3.

[The rubric is linked here.](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html)

The goals and objectives were to use the technology youâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery React, Router, Asynchronous JavaScript, end-to-end testing with Cypress, and creating personas and user stories to describe a target audience.

## Motivation

Why is this important?

According to respondents of the [US Transgender Survey](https://www.ustranssurvey.org/):
- 59% avoided using a restroom for fear of confrontation
- 31% avoided eating/drinking to avoid restrooms
- 24% had their presence in the restroom questioned
- 12% were harassed, attacked, or sexually assaulted in a restroom
- 9% were denied restroom access
- 8% developed a kidney issue or UTI from avoiding restrooms

## Reflections

A challenge was working out stubbing.

Big successes were Router, API calls, data cleaning, and getting stubbing to work.

## Languages and technology

Utilizes JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML/JSX, NPM, Node, Cypress, Normalizer, & Surge

Built with Visual Studio Code

## Access and use website

Visit the site [here](link).

To read more about the site, select "FAQ" at the bottom right of the page.

To access restrooms, the user must enter the zip code where they are located, choose whether or not to check the "Gender Neutral Only?" box, and then click "Search Now".

They will be presented up to five of the closest restrooms that users deemed as safe to them.

To do additional searches, they user just enters searches for another zipcode, using the steps above.
